## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive media cleanup system implemented for the HAPA website to automatically delete FormMedia files from both the database and Cloudflare R2 storage when MediaContentSubmissions are deleted, preventing orphaned files and wasted storage space.

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: When deleting MediaContentSubmissions from the admin dashboard, associated FormMedia files were not being cleaned up from either the database or R2 storage, leading to:
- Orphaned files consuming storage space unnecessarily
- Growing storage costs over time
- Inconsistent data state between submissions and their files

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **FormMedia Deletion Hook** (`src/collections/FormMedia/hooks/deleteFromR2.ts`)
2. **MediaContentSubmissions Cleanup Hook** (`src/collections/MediaContentSubmissions/hooks/cleanupFormMedia.ts`)
3. **Updated Collection Configurations**
4. **Enhanced API Endpoint Documentation**

### Data Flow

```
MediaContentSubmissions DELETE
    ↓
beforeDelete Hook (cleanupFormMediaHook)
    ↓
Find FormMedia by submissionId + Extract URLs
    ↓
Bulk Delete Files from R2
    ↓
Delete FormMedia Database Records
    ↓
Submission Deletion Proceeds
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. FormMedia R2 Deletion Hook

**File**: `src/collections/FormMedia/hooks/deleteFromR2.ts`

**Features**:
- Single file deletion for individual FormMedia records
- Bulk deletion function for multiple files (up to 1000 per batch)
- Automatic R2 path resolution based on file extension
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Context-aware skipping for bulk operations

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
deleteFormMediaFromR2: CollectionBeforeDeleteHook
bulkDeleteFromR2(filenames: string[], submissionId?: string)
```

**R2 Path Organization**:
- Images: `forms/images/`
- Documents: `forms/documents/`
- Videos: `forms/videos/`
- Audio: `forms/audio/`
- Other: `forms/misc/`

### 2. MediaContentSubmissions Cleanup Hook

**File**: `src/collections/MediaContentSubmissions/hooks/cleanupFormMedia.ts`

**Features**:
- Dual-strategy file discovery (submissionId lookup + URL extraction)
- Comprehensive URL extraction from submission data
- Bulk R2 file deletion
- Database record cleanup
- Detailed logging and error reporting
- Non-blocking error handling (doesn't prevent submission deletion)

**Cleanup Process**:
1. Find FormMedia records by `submissionId`
2. Extract file URLs from submission data as backup
3. Bulk delete files from R2 storage
4. Delete FormMedia database records
5. Log comprehensive cleanup report

### 3. Collection Configuration Updates

**FormMedia Collection** (`src/collections/FormMedia.ts`):
```typescript
hooks: {
  beforeDelete: [deleteFormMediaFromR2],
}
```

**MediaContentSubmissions Collection** (`src/collections/MediaContentSubmissions/index.ts`):
```typescript
import { cleanupFormMediaHook } from './MediaContentSubmissions/hooks/cleanupFormMedia'

hooks: {
  beforeDelete: [cleanupFormMediaHook],
}
```

### 4. API Endpoint Enhancement

**File**: `src/app/api/admin/update-submission/route.ts`

**Enhancement**: Added documentation explaining that the bulk delete endpoint automatically triggers FormMedia cleanup through collection hooks.

## File Structure

```

│   │       └── deleteFromR2.ts           # R2 file deletion logic

```

## Error Handling Strategy

### Non-Blocking Approach
- File cleanup errors don't prevent submission deletion
- Prevents database inconsistency issues
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### Error Recovery
- Detailed error logging with context
- Graceful degradation when R2 or database operations fail
- Continuation of cleanup process even if individual files fail

### Logging Levels
- **Info**: Successful operations and progress reports
- **Warn**: Partial failures that don't block the operation
- **Error**: Critical failures with full context

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

1. **Create Test Submission**:
   ```bash
   # Submit form with file attachments via frontend
   # Note the submission ID and file URLs
   ```

2. **Verify File Storage**:
   ```bash
   # Check R2 bucket for files in forms/ directories
   # Verify FormMedia database records exist
   ```

3. **Delete Submission**:
   ```bash
   # Delete via admin dashboard (single or bulk)
   # Monitor server logs for cleanup process
   ```

4. **Verify Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   # Check R2 bucket - files should be deleted
   # Check FormMedia collection - records should be deleted
   # Check logs for successful cleanup report
   ```

### Automated Testing

1. **Unit Tests** (Recommended):
   - Test URL extraction from submission data
   - Test R2 path generation logic
   - Test error handling scenarios

2. **Integration Tests** (Recommended):
   - End-to-end submission creation and deletion
   - R2 storage verification
   - Database consistency checks

### Test Scenarios

1. **Single Submission Deletion**
   - Create submission with multiple file types
   - Delete submission
   - Verify all files and records cleaned up

2. **Bulk Submission Deletion**
   - Create multiple submissions with files
   - Bulk delete via admin API
   - Verify all files and records cleaned up

3. **Error Scenarios**
   - R2 service unavailable
   - Database connection issues
   - Missing file references

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Submissions with no files
   - Files with non-standard extensions
   - Concurrent deletion attempts

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
- R2 client configuration verified (`src/utilities/r2-client.ts`)
- Environment variables properly set:
  - `R2_BUCKET_NAME`
  - `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `R2_ENDPOINT`

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy code changes
2. Run type generation: `pnpm generate:types`
3. Verify admin panel functionality
4. Test with non-production data first
5. Monitor logs during initial usage

### Monitoring
- Track cleanup success/failure rates in logs
- Monitor R2 storage usage over time
- Set up alerts for cleanup failures
- Regular verification of data consistency

## Performance Considerations

### Bulk Operations
- R2 bulk delete supports up to 1000 files per request
- Database deletions run in parallel where possible
- Batch processing prevents timeout issues

### Resource Usage
- Memory efficient URL extraction
- Streaming file operations where applicable
- Connection pooling for database operations

### Optimization Opportunities
- Implement cleanup job scheduling for failed operations
- Add cleanup metrics and monitoring dashboard
- Consider implementing cleanup verification checks

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Cleanup hooks only run for authenticated admin users
- R2 operations use secure, scoped credentials
- Database operations respect collection access policies

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data logged in error messages
- Secure file path handling prevents directory traversal
- Graceful handling of missing or corrupted data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **R2 Connection Failures**
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify R2 credentials and permissions
   - Test R2 client configuration

2. **Cleanup Not Triggered**
   - Verify hooks are properly registered in collections
   - Check for TypeScript compilation errors
   - Regenerate types: `pnpm generate:types`

3. **Partial Cleanup**
   - Check logs for specific error messages
   - Verify R2 bucket permissions
   - Test with smaller file batches

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check hook registration
pnpm generate:types

# Monitor cleanup process
tail -f logs/app.log | grep "MediaSubmissionCleanup\|FormMediaCleanup"

# Verify R2 configuration
node -e "const {getR2Client} = require('./dist/utilities/r2-client'); console.log(getR2Client());"
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Cleanup Verification Job**: Periodic job to verify and fix any missed cleanups
2. **Metrics Dashboard**: Admin interface showing cleanup statistics
3. **Bulk Cleanup Tools**: Administrative tools for cleaning up historical orphaned files
4. **Storage Analytics**: Integration with R2 analytics for storage optimization

### Monitoring Enhancements
1. **Cleanup Success Rate Tracking**: Metrics on cleanup operation success rates
2. **Storage Usage Alerts**: Automated alerts for unusual storage growth
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track cleanup operation performance over time
