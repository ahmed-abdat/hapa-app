# File Upload Validation Tests

## Test Plan for Media Form File Upload System

### Test Environment Setup
- Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server
- Access forms at: http://localhost:3000/fr/forms/media-content-complaint or media-content-report
- Monitor browser console and server logs

### Test Cases

#### 1. Successful File Upload (Happy Path)
**Test**: Submit form with valid files
- **Steps**:
  1. Fill out all required form fields
  2. Upload 1-2 valid image files (PNG/JPG < 5MB)
  3. Submit form
- **Expected Result**: 
  - Form submits successfully
  - Success message displayed
  - Admin dashboard shows files correctly at `/admin/collections/media-content-submissions`
  - Files are clickable and downloadable

#### 2. File Upload Failure Detection
**Test**: Simulate upload failures
- **Method 1 - Network Simulation**:
  1. Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Network
  2. Set throttling to "Offline" during file upload
  3. Submit form
- **Method 2 - Invalid Storage**:
  1. Temporarily break storage configuration
  2. Submit form with files
- **Expected Result**:
  - Form submission should fail with detailed error message
  - Toast notification shows file upload failure details
  - No database record should be created
  - User can retry submission

#### 3. Partial Upload Failure
**Test**: Multiple files with some failures
- **Steps**:
  1. Upload 3 files (mix of valid/invalid sizes)
  2. Force one file to fail (temporarily rename during upload)
  3. Submit form
- **Expected Result**:
  - Form should fail if any file fails
  - Error message should list specific failed files
  - Statistics should show X/Y files uploaded
  - No incomplete database record created

#### 4. File Validation Edge Cases
**Test**: Various file validation scenarios
- **Invalid file types**: Upload .exe, .bat files
- **Oversized files**: Upload >10MB files  
- **Empty files**: Upload 0-byte files
- **Malformed files**: Upload corrupted images
- **Expected Result**: Clear validation errors, no uploads attempted

#### 5. Admin Interface Display
**Test**: Verify admin dashboard shows files correctly
- **Steps**:
  1. Submit successful form with files
  2. Login to admin: http://localhost:3000/admin
  3. Navigate to Media Content Submissions
  4. Click on submission entry
- **Expected Result**:
  - "Lien/Capture d'√©cran" field shows file links (not "Fichier sans URL")
  - Files are clickable and open in new tab
  - Download buttons work correctly
  - File previews display for images

### Automated Testing Commands

```bash
# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Generate types
pnpm generate:types  

# Run build to check for issues
pnpm build
```

### Validation Checklist

#### Backend Validation ‚úÖ
- [x] Upload failure detection implemented
- [x] Error tracking and reporting
- [x] File count validation
- [x] URL validation before DB creation
- [x] Comprehensive logging

#### Frontend Validation ‚úÖ  
- [x] Enhanced error messages
- [x] Upload statistics display
- [x] Longer toast duration for file errors
- [x] Detailed error information

#### Admin Interface ‚úÖ
- [x] FileDisplayRowLabel component working
- [x] Database schema supports file arrays
- [x] Proper collection configuration

#### Data Integrity ‚úÖ
- [x] No database records created on upload failure
- [x] All-or-nothing upload validation
- [x] Transaction safety implemented

### Production Readiness Assessment

**Status**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** (Phase 1 Complete)

**Fixed Issues**:
- Silent file upload failures ‚Üí Now blocks form submission
- Missing error feedback ‚Üí Detailed error messages implemented  
- Data integrity issues ‚Üí Validation prevents incomplete records
- Admin display problems ‚Üí Will show files correctly once uploads succeed

**Next Phase** (Optional Enhancements):
- Parallel upload processing for better performance
- Enhanced progress indicators
- Monitoring and metrics collection

### Monitoring & Logs

**Key Log Messages to Watch**:
- `üì§ Starting file uploads...` - Upload process begins
- `‚úÖ All files uploaded successfully` - All uploads completed
- `‚ùå File upload validation failed` - Upload failure detected
- `‚úÖ Submission created successfully` - Database record created

**Error Patterns**:
- Look for mismatched file counts (expected vs uploaded)
- Monitor storage provider response times
- Check for network timeout issues
- Validate file URL formats

### Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production:
1. Revert API changes to previous version
2. Monitor upload success rates
3. Investigate specific failure patterns
4. Apply targeted fixes and redeploy

The system is designed to fail safely - if uploads fail, no incomplete data is created.
