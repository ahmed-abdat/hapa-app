---

## üîÑ Coordination Protocols

### Daily Standups
**Time**: Start of each work session  
**Duration**: 5 minutes per agent  
**Format**: What was completed, what's next, any blockers

### Integration Points
1. **API Changes**: Agent 3 (Security) must coordinate with Agent 1 (API logging)
2. **Component Changes**: Agent 2 (Performance) coordinates with Agent 4 (Testing)
3. **Build Process**: Agent 5 (DevOps) coordinates with all agents for CI/CD

### Conflict Resolution
- **File Conflicts**: Use feature branches, merge sequentially by priority
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Agent 4 (Architecture) resolves package.json conflicts
- **API Conflicts**: Agent 3 (Security) has final say on security-related APIs

## üìû Quick Communication

### Agent Status Tracking
Use this format for status updates:

```
Agent [N]: [Current Task] - [% Complete] - [ETA] - [Blockers]
Example: Agent 1: Logging cleanup - 75% - 2h remaining - None
```

### Emergency Coordination
If any agent encounters a blocking issue:
1. Post immediate status update
2. Tag relevant coordinating agents
3. Propose solution or request assistance
4. Continue with non-blocking tasks

---

**Next Steps**: 
1. Assign agents to team members
2. Create feature branches for each agent
3. Begin parallel execution
4. Set up daily coordination check-ins
