- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Implemented**:
  - âœ… Seamless integration with existing FormData workflow
  - âœ… Enhanced error boundary integration with comprehensive error categorization
  - âœ… Improved accessibility features with full ARIA support
  - âœ… Advanced keyboard navigation and RTL layout support
  - âœ… Full internationalization (French/Arabic) with cultural adaptations

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Security Enhancements Implemented
```typescript
// File signature validation integration
const isValidSignature = await validateFileSignature(file)
if (!isValidSignature) {
  return t('invalidFileFormat')
}

// File name sanitization check
const sanitizedName = sanitizeFilename(file.name)
if (sanitizedName !== file.name && sanitizedName.length < file.name.length * 0.5) {
  return t('invalidFileName')
}
```

### Performance Improvements Implemented
- Async file validation with loading states
- Memory-efficient URL cleanup for previews
- Sequential file processing to prevent browser freeze

### UX Improvements Implemented
- Enhanced drag feedback with ring effects
- Better loading states during validation
- Improved accessibility with additional ARIA labels
- Security information display for users

## Translation Keys Required

### New Translation Keys Needed
```json
{
  "invalidFileName": "File name contains invalid characters",
  "invalidFileFormat": "File format validation failed - file may be corrupted or malicious",
  "fileValidationError": "Unable to validate file security",
  "filesValidatedSecurity": "Files are validated for security before upload",
  "validatingFile": "Validating file security"
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Security Testing
- [ ] Test with various malicious file types
- [ ] Verify file signature validation works correctly
- [ ] Test with files that have mismatched extensions/MIME types
- [ ] Verify file name sanitization prevents path traversal

### Performance Testing  
- [ ] Test with large files (>10MB)
- [ ] Test with many files simultaneously
- [ ] Verify memory cleanup works correctly
- [ ] Test async validation doesn't block UI

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Verify keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test RTL layout with Arabic locale
- [ ] Verify ARIA labels are comprehensive

## Integration Notes

### Form System Integration
- Component maintains compatibility with existing React Hook Form setup
- File objects are properly passed to form validation system
- FormData conversion works with enhanced file validation

### API Integration
- Enhanced security validation runs client-side before upload
- Server-side validation still required for security defense in depth
- Upload endpoint receives pre-validated files with security metadata

## Next Steps
